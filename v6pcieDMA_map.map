WARNING:LIT:701 - PAD symbol "pci_exp_rxp<3>" has an undefined IOSTANDARD.
WARNING:LIT:702 - PAD symbol "pci_exp_rxp<3>" is not constrained (LOC) to a
   specific location.
Mapping design into LUTs...

Running directed packing...
ERROR:Pack:1107 - Pack was unable to combine the symbols listed below into a
   single IOB33 component because the site type selected is not compatible. 

   Further explanation:
   The component type is determined by the types of logic and the properties and
   configuration of the logic it contains. In this case an IO component of type
   IOB33 was chosen because the IO contains symbols and/or properties consistent
   with single ended I/O usage and a IOSTANDARD=LVDS_25 property. Please double
   check that the types of logic elements and all of their relevant properties
   and configuration options are compatible with the physical site type of the
   constraint.

   Summary:
   Symbols involved:
   	PAD symbol "adc_out_n_i<0>" (Pad Signal = adc_out_n_i<0>)
   	BUF symbol "adc_out_n_i<0>_IBUF" (Output Signal = adc_out_n_i<0>_IBUF)
   Component type involved: IOB33
   Site Location involved: AF13
   Site Type involved: IPAD


Mapping completed.
