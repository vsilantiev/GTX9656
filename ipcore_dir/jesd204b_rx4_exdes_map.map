WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2452 - The IOB TRACK_DATA_OUT is either not constrained
   (LOC) to a specific location and/or has an undefined I/O Standard
   (IOSTANDARD). This condition may seriously affect the device and will be an
   error in bitstream creation. It should be corrected by properly specifying
   the pin location and I/O Standard.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
