4. RESOLVED ISSUES 



5. KNOWN ISSUES & LIMITATIONS 

  - For GTH and GTP, the Wizard generates settings compatible for Prodcution Si. HW validation
    is of these settings is work in progress.

  - The Wizard generates Verilog wrappers for GTZ. VHDL is not supported.

  - For GTZ designs, the Wizard supports line rates and reference clocks shown in the GUI.
    No other values are tested or validated in hardware.

  - It is recommended that the Beachfront module generated for GTZ designs should NOT be
    modified by the user. Any edits made by the user might lead to unexpected results.

  - Support for Asymmetrical data widths on TX and RX (core generation and implementation only,     not supported in simulation)

  - Please note that Vivado flow should be used for implementation of all SSIT devices

  - Please note that the protocol templates provided by the Wizard are not characterised on
    hardware
